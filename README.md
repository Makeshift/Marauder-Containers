# Marauder-Containers
This contains the containers used in [Marauder](https://github.com/Makeshift/Marauder). When updated, they'll auto-build on my [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/makeshift27015).

Do not use these containers for normal usage. They are designed to be used with a Marauder setup only. They will do weird things if you try to use them for anything else.
